                        <h2>Aiden</h2>
                        <p class="p">Digger and rider from the womb, Aiden brings the classic, laid back, yet unbelievably technical style of the flyin Hawaiians crew. Adding unreasonable amounts of flow to years of racing experience, and topping it all off with mad videography skills, this is what's it's all about.</p>

                        <h2>Kai</h2>
                        <p class="p">He's mostly just there to be an example of what not to do. He's kinda crazy. In mid 2020 he assumed his true identity as the greatest vegetable, a gourd. After he healed up he got back on his bike he started racing again. He never did too well, but you can't expect too much from a newborn gourd.</p>

                        <h2>Kyle</h2>
                        <p class="p">Don't know if anyone has seen him with 2 wheels on the ground. Kyle J (KJ) is either in the air or on one wheel. He is just as happy jibbing simple curb set ups as he is lapping trails all day. Or even just a good day of digging. More then likely his ride will have all of those elements.</p>

                        <h2>Nathan</h2>
                        <p class="p">Nathan is the most Casual of the Crew but he still loves to get out and have fun on his bike. He enjoys biking out west of his hometown Manti When weather permits. His technical skills also have helped the crew with this website in specific.</p>
